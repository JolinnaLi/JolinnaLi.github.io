At the secluded Biological Research Station at Pembroke, Virginia, an analogous relationship between creative and scientific processes surfaced. It was one of trial and error, and at times, much frustration. When things come to a halt, one turns to community, conversing and exchanging ideas until it feels right to venture out again. And the effect is often a rippling one. The flow of inspiration from person to person, like the complex ecological networks that surround us, underscore the symbiotic relationship between the creator of the film and the many creators within the film. Between the artists, fantastical visions are transposed and realized, while ideas of transparency, authorial voice, and “candidness” are stretched, amplified, and questioned. This film was first screened at Mountain Lake at our student Artlab Showcase and was officially selected for the Down East Flick Fest in Greenville, North Carolina where it will be screened in late November.</p>\n</div><iframe class=film-yt src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgWBt0oGZjU\" title=\"YouTube player for a rolling stone gathers no moss\" frameborder=0 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe><div class=stills><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/1.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/2.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/3.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/4.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/5.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/6.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/7.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/8.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/9.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/10.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/11.webp'></div>","title_display":"a rolling stone gathers no moss","navgroup":"film"},"crows-mouth-film":{"page":"<div class=film-intro><h2 class=film-title>crow’s mouth</h2><div class=film-details><span><time>September 2023</time></span><span></span></div><p>Famous film director Sage Liu is caught off guard at her interview regarding her newest project, a biopic of her mother, depicting their complicated relationship and her difficult upbringing.

Frequenting childhood tales, wolves are a symbol of cunning and corruption. But what happens when the very things we warn children about are eliminated due to our collective, irreversible damage? Created by previous art resident Ed Miller at Mountain Lake, The Red Wolf wearily watches over the coming and going of field scientists, researchers, and their families to the research station. Spotting the statue in the dark, a displaced urbanite might scurry, not knowing that the only wolves that remain in the mountains are made from clay. On the surface, Mountain Lake is a secluded sanctuary – no cellular connection, lots of overgrown trails, and a self-sufficient plumbing system. Seeing a fallen Hemlock teeming with decomposers, beetles and fungus, one might muse at primordial beauty and remark on the cycle of life and the transient presence of humankind. But even so, the world around it is changing. Due to its elevation, the station had been free from poison ivy and ticks – until recently. The increase in temperatures have catalyzed these creatures’ slow creep to the station, including one that eats away at the hemlock population. Perhaps it’s time to start from scratch, turn to the very ecological networks that we harm, fighting for harmony. In Remember the Wolf, five photos meditate on stories passed down from generation to generation as the warning bells of the climate crisis crescendo.</p>\n</div><div class=stills><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/remember-the-wolf/1.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/remember-the-wolf/2.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/remember-the-wolf/3.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/remember-the-wolf/4.webp'><img class=still src='https://jolinnaliarchive.github.io/media/stills/remember-the-wolf/5.webp'></div>","title_display":"Remember the Wolf","navgroup":"photography"},"rooted":{"page":"<div class=photography-intro><h2 class=photography-title>Rooted</h2><p>Autumn Samone, in her series of images in <em>Rooted</em>, taken by Jolinna Li, creates a tree sculpture with synthetic hair, framing it alongside her body and the ethereal forest floor.

Whether personal or fictive, Li finds herself searching for the threads that connect us to one another across places, generations, and memories. Her work in film is an ongoing dialogue between the visible and invisible forces that shape identity—our inheritance, our choices, and the spaces we inhabit. Through narrative and form, she returns to the question: how do we make sense of the stories we carry? Her approach is always considering the relationships between the camera, gaze, and power—how visual framing reinforces dynamics of vulnerability and agency. Through camera movements, blocking, and mise-en-scène, Li invites the audience to engage intimately with relationship dynamics. At the heart of her work, Li aims to capture the trials of diaspora, navigating the interplay between tradition and modernity, kinship and displacement, both in communities and within individuals.</p>\n\t<div> Contact: <a href=\"mailto:jolinnayli@gmail.com\"><u>jolinnayli@gmail.com</u></a> <br> Resume: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"./Resume_Jolinna_Li.pdf\"><u>PDF</u></a> </div>\n</div>\n","title_display":"About","navgroup":"bio"}}
