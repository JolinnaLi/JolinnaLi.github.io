		<p>Li is interested in leveraging filmic architecture in combination with nested story structures to explore the tension and tenderness that define the human experience. Li's approach is always considering the relationships between the camera, gaze, and powerâ€”how visual framing reinforces dynamics of vulnerability and agency. These explorations rooted in personal encounters are then tested and escalated into a broader examination of the gaps within generational, geographical, and emotional landscapes. Individuals are bound by the thresholds of the frame as they reckon with  irreconcilable losses due to the failure of political and economic structures. But those same individuals also resist and revolt, and present-day, collective myth making emerges.</p>
